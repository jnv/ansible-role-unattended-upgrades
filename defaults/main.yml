# List of packages to not update

#Unattended-Upgrade::AutoFixInterruptedDpkg
# On a unclean dpkg exit unattended-upgrades will run

# The default is true, to ensure updates keep getting installed

#Unattended-Upgrade::MinimalSteps
# Split the upgrade into the smallest possible chunks so that
# they can be interrupted with SIGUSR1. This makes the upgrade
# a bit slower but it has the benefit that shutdown while a upgrade
# is running is possible (with a small delay)

# Install all unattended-upgrades when the machine is shuting down
# instead of doing it in the background while the machine is running
# This will (obviously) make shutdown slower

#Unattended-Upgrade::Mail
# Send email to this address for problems or packages upgrades
# If empty or unset then no email is sent, make sure that you
# have a working mail setup on your system. A package that provides
# 'mailx' must be installed.

# Set this value to "true" to get emails only on errors. Default
# is to always send a mail if Unattended-Upgrade::Mail is set

#Unattended-Upgrade::Remove-Unused-Dependencies
# Do automatic removal of new unused dependencies after the upgrade
# (equivalent to apt-get autoremove)

# Automatically reboot *WITHOUT CONFIRMATION* if a
# the file /var/run/reboot-required is found after the upgrade

#Unattended-Upgrade::MinimalSteps
# Split the upgrade into the smallest possible chunks so that

#Unattended-Upgrade::Mail
# Send email to this address for problems or packages upgrades
# If empty or unset then no email is sent, make sure that you
# have a working mail setup on your system. A package that provides
# 'mailx' must be installed.

# Do automatic removal of new unused dependencies after the upgrade
# (equivalent to apt-get autoremove)
